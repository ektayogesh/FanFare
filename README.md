This coding exrecise is done based on following assumptions
1 User name and image is not provided in the JSON response. I am assuming, I will have the user object from where I can get the data when I reach to this screen.For now I have hardcoded the username and provided a default image for profile.
2. I have implemented the JSON response of leaders in the table. "Overall" and "Friends" segments can be also taken care if we need to show separate sets of data in the table.
3. I haven't tried to replicate the UI .This can be done very easily if assets are provided .
